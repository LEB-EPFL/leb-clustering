* Telomere sizes can be assessed using STORM microscopy

** Reasoning: Fluorescent molecules mark DNA positions
   The radius of gyration of a point cloud that represents one
   telomere reflects the radius of gyration ($R_g$) of the underlying
   telomere. This is largely an assertion based on what we know of how
   STORM microscopy works and not necessarily a conclusion that can be
   strictly proven.

** Support: Our numbers are similar to the Zhuang lab paper
   The Zhuang lab measured diameters of the localization
   distribution. This number is roughly the same as our mean radius of
   gyration. While not direct evidence of this point, we can claim
   consistency with prior results. Also, the genomic lengths of their
   mouse embryonic fibroblasts are similar to ours.

** Weak point: the telomeres are not fully labeled
   The average number of localizations found in a telomere is between
   100 and 200. However, given a label size of 18 base pairs and an
   average genomic size of 10 kb for Hela S and 25 kb for Hela L, we
   know that this corresponds to a labeling efficiency of
   $\frac{100}{10000 / 18} = 0.18$, or about 20\%. This means
   undersampling might bias the results.

*** TODO variation in $R_g$ is small when subsampling
    We can remove points from telomere clusters and show the
    dependence of $R_g$ on the number of points removed. This would
    tell us how strongly the value depends on any given set of points.

*** TODO simulations of real $R_g$ vs. subsampled $R_g$
    We can simulate a large number of polymers and simulate what
    happens if we label only a fraction of their points.

** Weak point: the telomere size depends on number of frames
   We see a slight increase (~5 nm, or about 5\% to 6\% of the mean)
   in average size when the we image with 30,000 frames. This could be
   due to stage drift. It's supposedly corrected for using the
   autocorrelation method, but how precise is this method?

** Weak point: cluster sizes depend on staining
   Immunofluorescence staining of TRF1 showed a slightly smaller
   telomere size than DNA FISH staining. \textbf{But}, these
   measurements label different parts and may have different linker
   sizes between the label and the fluorescent marker. Is this a fair
   comparison?

** Weak point: small telomeres will appear disproportionately large
   Smaller telomere sizes will \textit{appear} disproportionately
   larger than their real size than larger ones due to the
   localization uncertainty.

*** Counter argument : this can be taken into account
    If we know the localization precision, we can correct for this. In
    fact, this effect is already taken into account in our estimation
    of the model parameters for compaction and persistence length.
    
** Weak point: DNA FISH ruins the local DNA structure
   I'm not sure if we can really debate this point or whether its
   known to what extent higher order structure is destroyed when
   performing FISH.

*** Counter argument: IF TRF1 measurements show similar sizes
    The immunofluorescence labeling can actually be a strong point in
    this case. Because we only measure a small change in size from IF,
    we can claim that the compaction of is roughly preserved when FISH
    is performed.

    The actual difference in Hela L TRF1 IF and Hela L WT FISH is
    about 20 nm in the mean radius of gyration.

* Telomeres in Hela cells have a large range of sizes

** Reasoning: the distributions tell us this
   Telomere sizes in Hela S(hort) and Hela L(ong) were measured by
   computing the radius of gyration of localized fluorescent molecules
   attached to the telomeres using DNA FISH. Wild type Hela S cells
   had telomeres with a mean radius of gyration of about 80 nm and a
   standard deviation between 25 and 30 nm. Hela L cells had a mean
   radius of gyration of about 100 nm and a standard deviation also
   between 25 and 30 nm.

   Both Hela L and S distributions contain one single, broad
   peak. They are slightly skewed to the left, suggesting a
   proportionally greater number of telomeres with larger gyration
   radii than smaller.

** Support: Consistency with Zhuang lab paper
   Our results for the $R_g$ distribution shape, mean, and width are
   also consistent with the previously mentioned Zhuang lab paper.

-----
* Telomeres can be modeled as linear polymers

** Reasoning: DNA is a linear polymer
   DNA is a linear polymer, so why not model telomeres like this?
   Strictly speaking, we're modeling the DNA as a linear polymer, not
   the DNA + telomere-associating proteins.

** Weak point: t-loops
   T-loops will make part of the polymer appear as circular, not
   linear. One of the best arguments we have for not including them is
   that t-loops contribute to the higher order structure in a way that
   influences the packing density. Since we assess the packing density
   in our model, we indirectly measure the effect of t-loops.

*** Counter argument: t-loops are highly heterogeneous
    Not all in vitro telomeres in the Zhuang paper have
    t-loops. Furthermore, if they did, the size of the loop relative
    to the entire size of the telomere varied by a very large amount
    (it was almost uniform, see Fig. 2G in the paper).

    Therefore, not accounting for the t-loop probably has less of an
    effect on our results than if every telomere had a t-loop. If
    every telomere had a t-loop, the linear polymer model would be
    much more biased.

*** Counter argument: t-loops are included in the packing density
    We measure the packing density of the linear polymer, in which
    higher order structure abstracted way into the details of the
    polymer fiber itself. t-loops may be one such higher order
    structure.

*** Counter argument: they've only been observed in vitro
    Is this true? Is it really a good argument to suggest they don't
    exist because we've never seen them in vivo?
    
** Weak point: G-quadruplexes
   We don't specifically allow for G-quadruplexies, at least
   directly...

*** Counter argument: These actually cause greater compaction
    Packaging by G-quadruplexes should effectively appear as a larger
    telomeric compaction in our model. Since we account for/measure
    compaction, we are indirectly including them. This also follows
    the same line of reasoning as the t-loops.

-----
* We can infer values for compaction and persistence length
** Reasoning: maximum likelihood reconstructions
   We perform a simulation of a large number of polymers at
   thermodynamic equilibrium and compare the $R_g$ distributions of
   the simulations to the measured data. This lets us place bounds on
   the compaction and to some extent the persistence length.

   Interestingly, \textbf{we find no evidence of a 30nm fiber}.
** Support: Timoth√©e has also done MLE work
** Weak point: The validity depends on linear polymer assumption
   See above for counter arguments.
** Weak point: We use the Southern blots as constraints
   We need to constrain the length of the polymer to infer its
   compaction. To do this, we use the Southern blots to make an
   estimate of the distribution of genomic lengths in the telomeres.

   I estimate the distributions as uniform, instead of Gaussian,
   because this is a maximum entropy estimate. The edges of the
   Southern blots might not reflect the genomic size but may instead
   be a result of the blot spreading, sort of like an impulse response
   of a linear system. This is also why I use the sharp edges of the
   uniform distribution.

*** TODO weak sensitivity to Southern blots
    I should run multiple simulations with different means and widths
    of the distributions to show that the results don't strongly
    depend on them.

-----
* TRF1 and TRF2 knockdowns affect telomere size
** Evidence: Visual comparison of distributions
   We see a consistent difference in $R_g$ distributions for Shelterin
   knockdowns.
*** TODO Plot individual dataset distributions
** Evidence: Significance tests
   The significance tests that I performed showed differences and a
   typical uncertainty in the mean of about 5 nm.
*** TODO Permutation tests
** Evidence: ChIP shows a correlation
   ChIP measurements show that TRF2 knockdowns should have a large
   amount of heterochromatic marks.
** Weak point: the controls differed from the wild type
   The control means differ from the wild type means, but not by as
   much as the Shelterin knockdowns. We can claim that this puts a
   limit of about 5 nm on what we can tell based on distributions.

-----
* Transfection causes subpopulations to appear
  We see a small spike at very small gyration radii when we transfect
  cells, either with a control or a real knockdown.
** Evidence: the distributions
