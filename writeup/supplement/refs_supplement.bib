abstract = {Recent advances in far-field fluorescence microscopy have led to substantial improvements in image resolution, achieving a near-molecular resolution of 20 to 30 nanometers in the two lateral dimensions. Three-dimensional (3D) nanoscale-resolution imaging, however, remains a challenge. We demonstrated 3D stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM) by using optical astigmatism to determine both axial and lateral positions of individual fluorophores with nanometer accuracy. Iterative, stochastic activation of photoswitchable probes enables high-precision 3D localization of each probe, and thus the construction of a 3D image, without scanning the sample. Using this approach, we achieved an image resolution of 20 to 30 nanometers in the lateral dimensions and 50 to 60 nanometers in the axial dimension. This development allowed us to resolve the 3D morphology of nanoscopic cellular structures.},

abstract = {Fluorescent proteins are known to display in certain cases an on-off
blinking and switching behavior. We could not yet find a report investigating
the impact of this phenomenon on super-resolution techniques that
are based on the sequential photoactivation and bleaching of individual
emitters such as photoactivated localization microscopy (PALM). In
our hands, even monomeric (m)Eos2, one of the most promising photoconvertible
fluorescent proteins reported in this journal, had non-negligible
light-induced fluorescence recovery (Supplementary Figs. 1 and 2).
This is particularly important for imaging membrane receptors, for
which phenomena such as oligomerization and clustering of proteins
can be properly identified only if the number of their constituents
is correctly estimated.},

abstract = {Little is known about how chromatin folds in its native state. Using optimized in situ hybridization and live imaging techniques have determined compaction ratios and fiber flexibility for interphase chromatin in budding yeast. Unlike previous studies, ours examines nonrepetitive chromatin at intervals short enough to be meaningful for yeast chromosomes and functional domains in higher eukaryotes. We reconcile high-resolution fluorescence in situ hybridization data from intervals of 14-100 kb along single chromatids with measurements of whole chromosome arms (122-623 kb in length), monitored in intact cells through the targeted binding of bacterial repressors fused to GFP derivatives. The results are interpreted with a flexible polymer model and suggest that interphase chromatin exists in a compact higher-order conformation with a persistence length of 170-220 nm and a mass density of approximately 110-150 bp/nm. These values are equivalent to 7-10 nucleosomes per 11-nm turn within a 30-nm-like fiber structure. Comparison of long and short chromatid arm measurements demonstrates that chromatin fiber extension is also influenced by nuclear geometry. The observation of this surprisingly compact chromatin structure for transcriptionally competent chromatin in living yeast cells suggests that the passage of RNA polymerase II requires a very transient unfolding of higher-order chromatin structure.},

abstract = {Chromosome architecture plays an essential role for all nuclear functions, and its physical description has attracted considerable interest over the last few years among the biophysics community. These researches at the frontiers of physics and biology have been stimulated by the demand for quantitative analysis of molecular biology experiments, which provide comprehensive data on chromosome folding, or of live cell imaging experiments that enable researchers to visualize selected chromosome loci in living or fixed cells. In this review our goal is to survey several nonmutually exclusive models that have emerged to describe the folding of DNA in the nucleus, the dynamics of proteins in the nucleoplasm, or the movements of chromosome loci. We focus on three classes of models, namely molecular crowding, fractal, and polymer models, draw comparisons, and discuss their merits and limitations in the context of chromosome structure and dynamics, or nuclear protein navigation in the nucleoplasm. Finally, we identify future challenges in the roadmap to a unified model of the nuclear environment.},

NP works for arbitrary clusters, is a single-scan technique, requires no presumptions regarding data distribution and requires only one input parameter, which describes the minimal number of objects, considered as cluster. Moreover, a comparison of NP with partitioning approaches is demonstrated. NP can be applied not only for data clustering, but also for the identification of outliers.

abstract = {A model for the flexibility of DNA is proposed that is based on discrete variations in the direction of propagation in going from one subunit to the next. Expansion of the local free energy in terms of the local bending gives a Gaussian distribution function. The assumption of the independence of local bends on neighbors lead to very simple formulae for the persistence length and the characteristic ratio. Emphasis, however, is placed on the application of the formulae for molecules of finite size where the persistence length and \$C\_\{\backslash infty\}\$ are not defined. The formulae are worked out for two models, which should serve as limits for the real physical situtation.},
