abstract = {Mammalian telomeres are specialized chromatin structures that require the telomere binding protein, TRF2, for maintaining chromosome stability. In addition to its ability to modulate DNA repair activities, TRF2 also has direct effects on DNA structure and topology. Given that mammalian telomeric chromatin includes nucleosomes, we investigated the effect of this protein on chromatin structure. TRF2 bound to reconstituted telomeric nucleosomal fibers through both its basic N-terminus and its C-terminal DNA binding domain. Analytical agarose gel electrophoresis (AAGE) studies showed that TRF2 promoted the folding of nucleosomal arrays into more compact structures by neutralizing negative surface charge. A construct containing the N-terminal and TRFH domains together altered the charge and radius of nucleosomal arrays similarly to full-length TRF2 suggesting that TRF2-driven changes in global chromatin structure were largely due to these regions. However, the most compact chromatin structures were induced by the isolated basic N-terminal region, as judged by both AAGE and atomic force microscopy. Although the N-terminal region condensed nucleosomal array fibers, the TRFH domain, known to alter DNA topology, was required for stimulation of a strand invasion-like reaction with nucleosomal arrays. Optimal strand invasion also required the C-terminal DNA binding domain. Furthermore, the reaction was not stimulated on linear histone-free DNA. Our data suggest that nucleosomal chromatin has the ability to facilitate this activity of TRF2 which is thought to be involved in stabilizing looped telomere structures.},

abstract = {Little is known about how chromatin folds in its native state. Using optimized in situ hybridization and live imaging techniques have determined compaction ratios and fiber flexibility for interphase chromatin in budding yeast. Unlike previous studies, ours examines nonrepetitive chromatin at intervals short enough to be meaningful for yeast chromosomes and functional domains in higher eukaryotes. We reconcile high-resolution fluorescence in situ hybridization data from intervals of 14-100 kb along single chromatids with measurements of whole chromosome arms (122-623 kb in length), monitored in intact cells through the targeted binding of bacterial repressors fused to GFP derivatives. The results are interpreted with a flexible polymer model and suggest that interphase chromatin exists in a compact higher-order conformation with a persistence length of 170-220 nm and a mass density of approximately 110-150 bp/nm. These values are equivalent to 7-10 nucleosomes per 11-nm turn within a 30-nm-like fiber structure. Comparison of long and short chromatid arm measurements demonstrates that chromatin fiber extension is also influenced by nuclear geometry. The observation of this surprisingly compact chromatin structure for transcriptionally competent chromatin in living yeast cells suggests that the passage of RNA polymerase II requires a very transient unfolding of higher-order chromatin structure.},

However, little is known about when these foci assemble or their relative stability. We developed a quantitative single-cell approach to characterize protein spatiotemporal organization, with single-molecule sensitivity in live eukaryotic cells. We observed that Pol II clusters form transiently, with an average lifetime of 5.1 (Â± 0.4) seconds, which refutes the notion that they are statically assembled substructures. Stimuli affecting transcription yielded orders-of-magnitude changes in the dynamics of Pol II clusters, which implies that clustering is regulated and plays a role in the cell's ability to effect rapid response to external signals. Our results suggest that transient crowding of enzymes may aid in rate-limiting steps of gene regulation.},

To explore TAD structure and function, we developed a polymer model that can extract the full repertoire of chromatin conformations within TADs from population-based 3C data. This model predicts actual physical distances and to what extent chromosomal contacts vary between cells. It also identifies interactions within single TADs that stabilize boundaries between TADs and allows us to identify and genetically validate key structural elements within TADs. Combining the model's predictions with high-resolution DNA FISH and quantitative RNA FISH for TADs within the X-inactivation center (Xic), we dissect the relationship between transcription and spatial proximity to cis-regulatory elements. We demonstrate that contacts between potential regulatory elements occur in the context of fluctuating structures rather than stable loops and propose that such fluctuations may contribute to asymmetric expression in the Xic during X inactivation.},

These researches at the frontiers of physics and biology have been stimulated by the demand for quantitative analysis of molecular biology experiments, which provide comprehensive data on chromosome folding, or of live cell imaging experiments that enable researchers to visualize selected chromosome loci in living or fixed cells. In this review our goal is to survey several nonmutually exclusive models that have emerged to describe the folding of DNA in the nucleus, the dynamics of proteins in the nucleoplasm, or the movements of chromosome loci. We focus on three classes of models, namely molecular crowding, fractal, and polymer models, draw comparisons, and discuss their merits and limitations in the context of chromosome structure and dynamics, or nuclear protein navigation in the nucleoplasm. Finally, we identify future challenges in the roadmap to a unified model of the nuclear environment.},

These maps confirm the presence of chromosome territories and the spatial proximity of small, gene rich chromosomes. We identified an additional level of genome organization that is characterized by the spatial segregation of open and closed chromatin to form two genome-wide compartments. At the megabase scale, the chromatin conformation is consistent with a fractal globule, a knot-free conformation that enables maximally dense packing while preserving the ability to easily fold and unfold any genomic locus. The fractal globule is distinct from the more commonly used globular equilibrium model. Our results demonstrate the power of Hi-C to map the dynamic conformations of whole genomes.},

@phdthesis{Martin2008,
abstract = {Over the few last decades there have been incredible breakthroughs in tracking individual points on a chromosome in living cells. This has revealed that both eukaryotic and prokaryotic chromosomes are highly organized. This organization is believed to arise from protein-mediated interactions that can form both inter and intra-chromosome tethers as well as anchoring the chromosome to the membrane or protein scaffolds. A combination of theoretical and experimental techniques is required to identify the locations of these tethers. The tethering points have an effect on the measured distances between the two fluorescently labeled points. In the case of a Gaussian polymer chain all possible arrangements of tethering along the polymer reduce to the form of a shifted Gaussian. This model depends only on an effective displacement, [special characters omitted], and an effective gyration coefficient, [special characters omitted], which refers to the effective length of the polymer between the tether and one of the fluorescent markers. The radial concentration portion of the distance distribution shows a clear tethering signature when [special characters omitted] > [special characters omitted]. The commonly used mean squared distance is unable to distinguish between a tethered and a free Gaussian polymer chain. Fluorescent markers were placed along the genome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae to address the problem of mating type switching. Data from an experiment that changed the effective binding energy between HML and MAT leads to a simple thermodynamic model of mating type switching. The fit of this model to the data predicts that the difference in free energy cost of bringing HML to MAT versus bringing HMR to MAT is 4kBT. Diffusion measurements between points on the chromatin do not show a mating type difference but result in a diffusion constant on the order of 10-4[special characters omitted]. These strains have also been used to plot the radial concentration between the spindle pole body and HML and also between HML and MAT. Data from the Haber lab shows a mating type difference in the radial concentration while data from Houston and Broach do not. Tools to investigate tethered polymer model in the Escherichia coli system have been developed. This includes the creation of a plasmid that inserts the parS gene and the chloramphenicol resistance randomly into the genome of E. coli. With the origin of replication and terminus already labeled, this insertion creates a strain of E. coli with three labeled loci capable of being tracked with fluorescent proteins in three distinct colors. Custom written Matlab software is used to find the E. coli cells and extract out the positions of the spots. Preliminary analysis of one such created strain does not show a tethering signature. A simple tethered polymer model has been applied successfully in the S. cerevisiae system. Furthermore, a collection of tools were created to apply this model to E. coli. This has led to the possibility of extracting the gyration coefficient for chromatin in living cells thereby providing important clues to its structure. The organization of chromatin can be extracted because these models have the power to locate tethering points along the chromatin. This understanding of the physical structure will shed light into the poorly understood role of structure and organization in such processes as gene regulation, recombination and chromosomal segregation.},

Recent characterization of human chromatin using a novel chromosome conformational capture technique brought the fractal globule into the spotlight as a structural model of human chromosome on the scale of up to 10Â Mb (Lieberman-Aiden et al. 2009). Here, we present the concept of the fractal globule, comparing it to other states of a polymer and focusing on its properties relevant for the biophysics of chromatin. We then discuss properties of the fractal globule that make it an attractive model for chromatin organization inside a cell. Next, we connect the fractal globule to recent studies that emphasize topological constraints as a primary factor driving formation of chromosomal territories. We discuss how theoretical predictions, made on the basis of the fractal globule model, can be tested experimentally. Finally, we discuss whether fractal globule architecture can be relevant for chromatin packing in other organisms such as yeast and bacteria.},

abstract = {Human telomeres, the nucleoprotein complexes at chromosome ends, consist of tandem arrays of TTAGGG repeats bound to specific proteins. In normal human cells, telomeres shorten with successive cell divisions, probably due to the terminal sequence loss that accompanies DNA replication. In tumours and immortalized cells, this decline is halted through the activation of telomerase, a reverse transcriptase that extends the telomeric TTAGGG-repeat arrays. Telomere length is stable in several immortal human-cell lines, suggesting that a regulatory mechanism exists for limiting telomere elongation by telomerase. Here we show that the human telomeric-repeat binding factor TRF1 (ref. 8) is involved in this regulation. Long-term overexpression of TRF1 in the telomerase-positive tumour-cell line HT1080 resulted in a gradual and progressive telomere shortening. Conversely, telomere elongation was induced by expression of a dominant-negative TRF1 mutant that inhibited binding of endogenous TRF1 to telomeres. Our results identify TRF1 as a suppressor of telomere elongation and indicate that TRF1 is involved in the negative feedback mechanism that stabilizes telomere length. As TRF1 does not detectably affect the expression of telomerase, we propose that the binding of TRF1 controls telomere length in cis by inhibiting the action of telomerase at the ends of individual telomeres.},

abstract = {Remodeling of the local chromatin structure is essential for the regulation of gene expression. While a number of biochemical and bioimaging experiments suggest decondensed chromatin structures are associated with transcription, a direct visualization of DNA and transcriptionally active RNA polymerase II (RNA pol II) at super-resolution is still lacking. Here we investigate the structure of chromatin isolated from HeLa cells using binding activatable localization microscopy (BALM). The sample preparation method preserved the structural integrity of chromatin. Interestingly, BALM imaging of the chromatin spreads revealed the presence of decondensed chromatin as gap structures along the spreads. These gaps were enriched with phosphorylated S5 RNA pol II, and were sensitive to the cellular transcriptional state. Taken together, we could visualize the decondensed chromatin regions together with active RNA pol II for the first time using super-resolution microscopy.},
