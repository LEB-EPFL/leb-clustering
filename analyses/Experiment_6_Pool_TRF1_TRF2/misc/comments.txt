These zip files correspond to:

All_Datasets -- every dataset from 05-11-2014 was kept
X_Two_Datasets -- 05-11-2014 Hela S pSuper and TRF2 were removed from
	          the pool
No_05-11-2014 -- No datasets from 05-11-2014 were included in the pool

The only different between X_Two_Datasets and the zip file in the
upper level directory is that the one in the upper directory contains
plots of the median values as well.
